### Hi! ğŸ‘‹

This is my README. There are many like it, but this one is mine, and it doesn't have a whole lot of instructions.

I identify as a software developer; preferably the backend kind but companies have raised me "full stack". In my spare time I enjoy exploring new paradigms and pretending to be a polyglot.
